# Linux Docs

This repository is my collection of Linux troubleshooting notes, system setup guides, and automation scripts.  

It’s meant as both:
- A **personal knowledge base** I can reference later
- A **portfolio** for employers to see my problem-solving process

---

## Structure
- `setup/` → OS and server setup notes
- `troubleshooting/` → Problems I encountered and how I solved them
- `scripts/` → Bash/Python scripts I’ve written
- `security/` → Lab notes, CTF write-ups, and security-related experiments

---

## Example Topics
- Setting up Arch Linux
- Fixing PipeWire audio issues
- Automating backups with Bash
- Configuring SSH keys for servers
